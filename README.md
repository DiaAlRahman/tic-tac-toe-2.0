# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a modularized and efficient implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It leverages bitwise operations to determine the game status efficiently, ensuring optimal performance.

## Features

- **Efficient Game Status Check**: The game uses bitwise representation for each player's moves to track the game state. The winning conditions are predefined in an array, reducing the need for brute force checking.

- **Modularized Codebase**: The project is structured using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs), promoting a clean and organized codebase.

- **User-Centric Design**: The development process prioritized a user-focused perspective, ensuring intuitive gameplay.

- **Restart Logic**: Implements a robust restart mechanism, removing all game states and players from memory for a fresh start.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Front-End Development
- JavaScript
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Software Project Management
